In which decade was the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) founded?,1850s,1880s,1930s,1950s,1880s,"The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) was formed in 1963 by the merger of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE, founded 1912) and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, founded 1884)."
In which decade with the first transatlantic radio broadcast occur?,1850s,1860s,1870s,1900s,1900s,"On December 12, 1901, a radio transmission received by Guglielmo Marconi resulted in the first transmission of a transatlantic wireless signal (Morse Code) from Poldhu, Cornwall, to St. John's, Newfoundland. "
In which decade was the SPICE simulator introduced?,1950s,1960s,1970s,1980s,1970s,"SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) was introduced in May 1972 by the University of Berkeley, California."
Most modern TV's draw power even if turned off. The circuit the power is used in does what function?,Sound,Remote control,Color balance,High voltage,Remote control,"Some authorities are recommending TV's, VCR's and Stereo's be connected to power strips with switches and turned off when not in use to save energy. Your remote will not work until power is switched back on.  "
Which is a type of Electrically-Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory?,Flash,Flange,Fury,FRAM,Flash,"It's commonly used for MP3 players, computer BIOS code and ""thumb"" drives. Originally developed in Japan by Toshiba, it has become quite popular for products requiring non-volatile erasable memory. Flash devices have a limited number of erase cycles (typically 10,000 to 1,000,000 cycles) so they're not as good a choice for applications in which the data changes constantly. However, since it has no moving parts (unlike a hard disk) it is an excellent choice for storing the operating code for small personal electronics like PDAs, cell phones, digital cameras, and the data in items like MP3 players. "
"Made from a variety of materials, such as carbon, which inhibits the flow of current...?",Choke,Inductor,Resistor,Capacitor,Resistor,So named because it resists (or inhibits) the flow of current. 
The most common format for a home video recorder is VHS. VHS stands for...?,Video Home System,Very high speed,Video horizontal standard,Voltage house standard,Video Home System,"JVC (Japan Victor Corporation) and Matsushita (Panasonic) developed the VHS format to compete with Sony which developed the Beta format as the first home video cassette recorder. VHS originally stood for Vertical Helical Scan, but now means Video Home System. "
What does VVVF stand for?,Variant Voltage Vile Frequency,Variable Velocity Variable Fun,Very Very Vicious Frequency,Variable Voltage Variable Frequency,Variable Voltage Variable Frequency,"It is a method of controlling the speed of an AC induction motor, whereby speed, current and torque can all be accurately controlled. "
What frequency range is the High Frequency band?,100 kHz,1 GHz,30 to 300 MHz,3 to 30 MHz,3 to 30 MHz,The HF band is based on frequencies 3 to 30 Mhz. AM radio stations are in the HF band but normally are stated in kilohertz.
The first step to getting output from a laser is to excite an active medium. What is this process called?,Pumping,Exciting,Priming,Raising,Pumping,"A collection of atoms or molecules that can be excited to a higher energy state is called an active medium. Before lasing can occur, the active media is ""pumped"". The process of raising the atoms in the active media from a lower energy state to a higher state is like pumping water up from a well. "
